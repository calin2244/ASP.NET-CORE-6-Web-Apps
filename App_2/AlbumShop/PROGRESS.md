Took a one week break from programming! Two days ago I came back, I really missed doing this. So, what's new? 
- custom URLs(using the MapControllerRoute) so they make more sense(they are readable
- new side buttons(a navigation menu - I plan moving them to the top of the site in the upper nav bar)
- very little progress on the shopping cart
