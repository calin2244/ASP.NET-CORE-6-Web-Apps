  This app was made using the .NET 6.0.100 SDK and the ASP.NET Core 6 functionalities.
  Run the 
  ```cs
  dotnet run
  ```
  command and access http://localhost:5000/ to view the app. I plan to deploy the web apps after I feel more confident with my web apps.

This is my first ever Web App that I've created using the ASP.NET Core 6 framework.

  This is the main page. There are still things to add like pictures or more details, but as this is my first project, I will leave it as it is.  
  Clicking the Attend the party button will send you to a new View where you need to complete the Invite Formular.

  I've added Error Annotations(some are custom), for each input.

  After you've correctly completed the formular, you can check who's coming to the party!
  At the moment there is no SQL Database, just a simple C# Class that keeps track of every GuestResponse instance.
